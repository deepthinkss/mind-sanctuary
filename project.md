# Smart Personal Knowledge Hub — Project Documentation

## Overview

A modern, minimalist **AI-powered Second Brain** that turns scattered thoughts into a connected, goal-aware knowledge system. Users write brain dumps; the AI organizes them into summaries, tags, folders, semantic clusters, **typed relations between notes (knowledge graph)**, and **goal progress with next-step suggestions**.

## AI Models — Google Gemini via Lovable AI Gateway

All AI features route through the **Lovable AI Gateway** (`https://ai.gateway.lovable.dev/v1/chat/completions`), which is OpenAI-compatible and authenticated via the auto-provisioned `LOVABLE_API_KEY` secret. Calls are **never made from the client** — every request goes through a Deno Edge Function for security and prompt control.

### Default Model: `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`

Used by every edge function in this project. It's a fast, cost-efficient preview of Google's next-generation Gemini model with strong reasoning at low latency — the right balance for note processing, search, and chat.

### Available Google models on the gateway

| Model                                    | Best for                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `google/gemini-3-flash-preview` ✅ used  | Fast multipurpose reasoning (default for all functions)           |
| `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`          | Heaviest reasoning, latest preview                                |
| `google/gemini-2.5-pro`                  | Multimodal + complex reasoning, large context                     |
| `google/gemini-2.5-flash`                | Balanced cost/latency vs Pro                                      |
| `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`           | Cheapest, simple classification/summarization                     |
| `google/gemini-3-pro-image-preview`      | Image generation                                                  |
| `google/gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`  | Fast image generation/editing                                     |

### Patterns used

- **Tool-calling for structured output** — `process-note`, `generate-questions`, `semantic-search`, `cluster-notes` all force a `tool_choice` so the model returns clean, schema-validated JSON instead of free text.
- **SSE streaming** — `chat-with-notes` streams tokens from the gateway directly through to the client for the Second Brain chat.
- **Plain completion** — `rewrite-note` uses a simple chat completion for tone/length transforms.
- **Error surfacing** — every function maps `429` → "Rate limited" and `402` → "AI credits exhausted" so the UI can show a meaningful toast.

## Feature Phases

### Phase 0 — Core (MVP)

- Email/password auth with Supabase, RLS-protected `notes` table.
- Smart Save: write a note → `process-note` returns `{ summary, tags, folder }` → stored in DB.
- AI Suggest: enter a topic → `suggest-notes` returns 3 starter notes.
- Responsive card grid, keyword search, folder filter, light/dark theme.

### Phase 1 — Organization & Navigation

- **Pin & priority notes** — `pinned` boolean column; pinned notes sort to the top.
- **Markdown rendering** — `react-markdown` in `NoteCard` for headings, lists, bold, code.
- **Custom tag editing** — inline add/remove tags directly on a card.
- **Command Palette** (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`) — quick navigation to input, search, theme toggle.

### Phase 2 — AI Content Tools & Views

- **Rewrite & Expand** (`rewrite-note`) — five actions: rewrite, expand, simplify, professional, casual. Re-runs `process-note` after to refresh metadata.
- **Reflective Questions** (`generate-questions`) — generates 3 Socratic questions per note.
- **Timeline View** — notes grouped chronologically by date.
- **Focus Mode** — full-screen distraction-free editor with character counter.
- **Date Filter** — calendar-based filtering by created date.
- **Edit existing notes** — full edit + re-run AI processing.

### Phase 3 — Discovery & Visualization

- **Second Brain Chat** (`chat-with-notes`) — floating streaming chat that uses the user's notes as context.
- **Knowledge Dashboard** (`KnowledgeDashboard.tsx`) — weekly activity bars, tag frequency, folder stats.
- **Topic Clustering** (`cluster-notes`) — AI groups notes into 2–6 named semantic clusters.

### Phase 4 — Productivity

- **To-do List View** (`TodoList.tsx`) — dedicated view mode (alongside Grid, Timeline, Insights, Clusters) with add/toggle/delete tasks, All/Active/Done filters, and `localStorage` persistence. Replaces the prior floating popup.
- **Search simplification** — semantic search removed; keyword search via `SearchBar` is the single search path.

---

### Phase 5 — Knowledge Graph & Goal-Oriented System

**Knowledge Graph** — notes stop being isolated cards and become a connected graph of ideas.

- New `note_relations` table (`source_note_id`, `target_note_id`, `relation_type` ∈ `related_to|extends|contradicts`, `confidence`, RLS-scoped to the user).
- New edge function `link-notes` — sends a new note + candidate notes to Gemini and uses tool-calling to return the top 3–5 typed relations with confidence scores.
- **Auto-linking** — `Dashboard.handleSave` invokes `link-notes` in the background after every save and upserts the relations.
- **Graph View** (`GraphView.tsx`) — renders notes as nodes and relations as edges using a custom force-directed SVG simulation (no extra deps). Click a node to highlight connections, see a side panel with linked notes, and remove relations. The toolbar action **AI Link Notes** re-runs linking on demand.
- **Goal overlay** — nodes belonging to any goal are tinted with the primary color so the graph doubles as a goal-progress visualization.

**Goal-Oriented System** — connects notes to user goals and tracks progress intelligently.

- New `goals` table (`title`, `description`, `status` ∈ `active|completed`, RLS) and `goal_notes` junction table.
- **Goals View** (`GoalsView.tsx`) — create/edit/delete goals, toggle complete, and click a goal to expand a checklist that links/unlinks any note.
- New edge function `suggest-goal-notes` — on goal creation, Gemini picks the 3–7 most relevant existing notes and they are auto-linked.
- New edge function `analyze-goal` — on demand, returns `{ progress%, summary, missing_knowledge[], next_steps[] }` rendered with a progress bar, gap badges, and a next-steps list.
- **Second Brain Chat now includes goals** — `chat-with-notes` accepts a `goals` array and prepends them to the system prompt so answers are aware of what the user is trying to accomplish.

---

### Phase 6 — Developer Productivity

- **Tag filtering & tag cloud** (`TagFilter.tsx`) — multi-select tag chips above the grid that combine with search/folder/date filters. The Insights view also renders a frequency-weighted tag cloud.
- **Code syntax highlighting** (`CodeBlock.tsx`) — fenced code blocks inside notes are highlighted via `react-syntax-highlighter` (Prism, light/dark theme aware) with a per-block copy-to-clipboard button.
- **Markdown export** — each note card has a Download (⬇) action that exports the raw markdown content as a `.md` file (browser-side `Blob`, no backend call).

---

### Phase 7 — Reliability & Observability

- **Smart Save preview & edit** (`NoteInput.tsx`) — after `process-note` returns, the AI-generated **summary, folder, and tags** are shown in an inline review card. Users can rename the folder, add/remove tags (Enter / comma to add, Backspace to delete the last), or dismiss before committing. Only on **Save note** does the data get persisted, so AI output is always editable before it lands in the DB.
- **Edge Function health check** (`supabase/functions/health-check/index.ts` + `HealthStatus.tsx`) — a dedicated edge function pings every other function with `OPTIONS` requests in parallel and reports `{ overall, env: { aiKeyConfigured, supabaseUrl }, functions: [{ name, status, httpStatus, latencyMs, error }] }`. The dashboard header shows a live status icon (green/amber/red) with a popover listing per-function latency, HTTP code, and **per-function error messages** when down. Auto-refreshes every 60s. Configured with `verify_jwt = false` in `supabase/config.toml`.
- **Per-function AI error banner** (`AiActivityBanner.tsx`) — every AI call in `Dashboard.tsx` is routed through a `callAiFn` wrapper that records `{ message, at }` per function name on failure and the **last successful AI summary** on success. A banner above the note input shows current per-function errors (dismissible) alongside the most recent successful result, so a failed `process-note` / `link-notes` / `rewrite-note` / `generate-questions` / `analyze-goal` call never wipes the user's previous successful AI output and always surfaces the specific error message.
- **Note version history** (`NoteHistoryDialog.tsx` + `note_versions` table) — a Postgres trigger (`snapshot_note_version`) snapshots the previous `{ content, summary, folder, tags }` of a note into `note_versions` whenever any of those fields change, tagged as `edit` or `ai_update`. Each `NoteCard` exposes a History button that opens a dialog listing all prior versions with timestamp, change type, and a **Restore** action that loads the version back into the editor.
- **Client-only home route fix** (`src/routes/index.tsx`) — replaced the unavailable `ClientOnly` import from `@tanstack/react-router` with a local `mounted` gate so the Supabase auth bootstrap only runs in the browser without breaking the dynamic route module load.

### Product Roadmap

#### ✅ Markdown / PDF Import & Export

Allow users to seamlessly import notes in **Markdown (`.md`) and PDF formats**, making migration from other tools effortless. Export notes, collections, or entire workspaces into **clean Markdown files or shareable PDFs** for backup, collaboration, or offline access. Formatting, headings, links, and embedded content should remain intact during conversion.

#### ✅ Daily Brain-Dump Prompt with Streak Tracking

Introduce a **daily reflection / brain-dump system** that encourages consistent journaling and idea capture. Users receive a simple prompt each day (e.g., *“What’s on your mind today?”* or *“What are you focusing on?”*). Track consistency with **streaks, completion history, and activity insights** to build long-term habits without adding pressure.

#### ✅ Drag-and-Drop Notes Between Folders

Enable a **smooth drag-and-drop interface** for organizing notes. Users can quickly move notes between folders, categories, or projects without opening settings or menus. Include **visual feedback, nested folder support, and instant sync updates** to make workspace organization feel effortless.

#### ✅ Voice-to-Note with Gemini Transcription

Add **voice recording capabilities** so users can instantly convert spoken thoughts into notes using **Gemini-powered transcription**. Support **real-time speech-to-text**, punctuation detection, and automatic formatting for readability. Ideal for quick idea capture, meetings, or hands-free note-taking.

#### ✅ Realtime Multi-Device Sync (Notes, Relations, Goals)

Implement **real-time synchronization across all devices** so updates appear instantly whether users are on desktop, tablet, or mobile. Sync not only notes, but also **graph relations, goals, tags, and workspace structure**, ensuring a consistent experience everywhere with conflict resolution for simultaneous edits.

#### ✅ Sync To-Do List to Backend (Currently `localStorage`)

Move the to-do system from **browser `localStorage` to a secure backend database**, enabling persistence across devices and sessions. This allows **cloud backup, account-level sync, real-time updates, and improved reliability**, preventing task loss when switching browsers or clearing storage.

#### ✅ Weekly AI Digest: *“You’re progressing on X, focus on Y”*

Generate a **personalized weekly AI productivity report** summarizing user activity, learning progress, and focus patterns. The digest can highlight:

* What the user made progress on
* Areas receiving less attention
* Suggested priorities for the upcoming week
* Behavioral insights and productivity trends

Example:

> *“You made strong progress on product design this week. Your goal-planning activity dropped by 30% — consider revisiting roadmap priorities.”*

#### ✅ Drag-to-Create Relations in Graph View

Improve the graph experience by allowing users to **visually create relationships between notes using drag gestures**. Instead of manual linking, users can simply **drag from one node to another** to establish connections. Include **relation labels, previews, and auto-suggestions** for a more intuitive knowledge graph workflow.

#### ✅ Public API / Plugin System

Launch a **developer-friendly API and plugin ecosystem** to extend platform functionality. Users and developers can integrate external tools, automate workflows, and build custom extensions. Potential use cases:

* Calendar & task integrations
